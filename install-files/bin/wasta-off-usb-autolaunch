# wasta-off-usb-autolaunch
#
#   This script takes a device id as input, finds the mount point of the device
#       from df, determines the owner of the device, and finally launches
#       wasta-offline on the device owner's x display server.
#
#   pkexec would be cleaner, but then sending the authentication agent prompt
#       to the user's display is not working right (it only prompts in the terminal).
#
#   2014-03-21 rik: Initial script
#   2014-03-25 rik: changed "pidof" to "pgrep" so could find wasta-offline
#       process id.
#   2014-03-31 rik: renamed to "wasta-off-usb-autolaunch" so that 
#       "pgrep wasta-offline" won't return PID of this script!
#   2014-04-19 jcl: removed gksu since it wasn't working with a non-sudo user
