  * adding gksu dependency (trusty doesn't include it by default)

 -- Rik Shaw <rikshaw76@gmail.com>  Fri, 25 Apr 2014 11:14:17 -0500

wasta-offline (0.1.15) precise; urgency=low

  * $USER not defined when launching with gksu.  Also no $LOGNAME,
    $(logname), $(whoami), $(who), so needing to adjust
    12.10+ folder selection to just /media/*/*/wasta-offline

 -- Rik Shaw <rikshaw76@gmail.com>  Thu, 24 Apr 2014 12:11:21 -0500

wasta-offline (0.1.10) precise; urgency=low

  * Added jcl modifications to regen Packages list if it is found
    to be outdated (a .deb exists in the folder newer than the Packages file).
    This is optional so do not require a dpkg-scanpackages dependency,
    which would make it difficult to install wasta-offline manually on
    remote machines.

 -- Rik Shaw <rikshaw76@gmail.com>  Mon, 14 Apr 2014 12:21:39 -0500

wasta-offline (0.1.9) precise; urgency=low

    from "normal" internet repository
  * Reworked Progress Dialogs

 -- Rik Shaw <rikshaw76@gmail.com>  Wed, 09 Apr 2014 11:07:34 -0500

wasta-offline (0.1.6) precise; urgency=low

  * apt-mirror find command to load repositories: added "prune" of pool
    folders (approx. 100-fold speed increase!).  Also ensured that
    "precise-security" and "precise-updates" sections would be selected
    with a $UBU_SERIES-* find parameter (before was only selecting
    "precise/" as a valid section).

 -- Rik Shaw <rikshaw76@gmail.com>  Sat, 05 Apr 2014 17:48:19 -0500

wasta-offline (0.1.5) precise; urgency=low

  * wasta-offline-setup: split apart to separate package
  * wasta-offline: added timestamps to some log entries so can determine where
    need more "progress window" feedback for user (likely in apt-mirror

wasta-offline (0.1.4) precise; urgency=low

  * wasta-offline: backing up and restoring apt lists as well, so that after
    wasta-offline used, won't need to pull all lists from scratch from
    internet (that would be a download of maybe 16MB minimum).  Since
    restoring lists, will now do apt-get update when exiting to ensure
    package lists are in sync.
  * "space in usb drive name" compatibility modifications.
